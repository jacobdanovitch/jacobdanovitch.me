This is a repository for my personal website.

## Technologies used

### React

To give my site the feel of a React app, I used React-Router to reduce loading times to almost 0. I utilized React's components to prevent continually repeating the same code over and over, and leveraged many modules to improve the look, feel, and performance of my wbesite.

### HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Creating a complex, one-page, multi-component web app taught me a lot about getting creative with HTML and CSS. I used React-Bootstrap's excellent bootstrap wrapper, but had to get very resourceful at times in overwriting many properties. 

Since my initial commit, I have added Material-UI components, which have proved very easy to use and look great.

### Surge

Github Pages doesn't play nicely with client-side routing, so I migrated (with some effort; Github pages is a bit clingy) to [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh). Surge is an excellent, free host for static websites, and provided superb assistance in the migration process. 

## Remaining Work to be Done

* Fix active class on list iems (items not making text white if box is clicked, only if text is clicked)
* Adding a nicer way to navigate between sublevels of the About section
* Adding several other pages 
* Adding loading screens
* Fixing transitions (problem with the pathname splitting + nested about/ routes)
* Creating my own favicon
* Hosting projects
